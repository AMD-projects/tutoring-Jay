# Write a function that checks whether a given positive integer is a prime number or not.
# A prime number is a number which is only divisible by 1 and itself. Examples of prime numbers include: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19,

import math

print(math.factorial(3))
# def is_prime(number):
#     if number / 1 == number and number / number == 1:
#         print("It's prime!")
#     else:
#         return False
    
# print(is_prime())
