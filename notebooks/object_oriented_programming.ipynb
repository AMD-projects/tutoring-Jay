    "# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes. It allows you to model real-world entities as software objects, encapsulating both data and the methods (functions) that operate on that data. OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and a clearer structure in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concepts in OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes and Objects**: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have. An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attributes and Properties**: These are the data members of a class, representing the characteristics of an object. They can be variables of various types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Methods**: Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the class's data. They define the behavior of the objects created from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation**: This is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It provides control over access to the internal data of an object, promoting data hiding and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) that inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). It facilitates code reuse and specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables dynamic method binding and flexibility in implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on relevant attributes and behaviors. It hides the unnecessary details and exposes only the necessary features."

    "## 4. Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, often known as a class. Encapsulation provides control over the access and modification of data by restricting direct access to the internal details of an object. This promotes data hiding, information security, and abstraction, making your code more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more detailed explanation of encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Protection**: Encapsulation prevents external code from directly modifying or accessing the internal state of an object. This helps ensure that data integrity is maintained and that unexpected changes don't disrupt the functioning of other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.    **Abstraction**: Encapsulation allows you to provide a clear interface to the outside world while hiding the internal implementation details. Users of the class only need to know how to use the provided methods, not how they are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.    **Modularity**: By encapsulating data and methods related to a specific functionality within a class, you create modular units that can be easily maintained and updated. Changes within a class are less likely to affect other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access Modifiers:\n",
    "Access modifiers are keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods). They enforce the level of encapsulation by specifying who can access or modify certain elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the common access modifiers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Public**: No access restrictions. Members are accessible from anywhere. \n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: class MyClass: def my_method(self): pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protected**: Members are accessible within the class and its subclasses. To denote protected attributes, you can use a single underscore prefix (convention). Example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "_protected_attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private**: Members are only accessible within the class. To denote private attributes, you can use a double underscore prefix. However, they are not truly private; their names are \"mangled\" to make them harder to accidentally override. Example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "__private_attribute\n",

    "In summary, encapsulation in OOP involves bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) and controlling access to internal details. This promotes data security, abstraction, and modularity, making your code more organized and maintainable. Access modifiers further refine the level of encapsulation by specifying who can access class members."
