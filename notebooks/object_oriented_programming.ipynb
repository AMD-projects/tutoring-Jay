    "# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes. It allows you to model real-world entities as software objects, encapsulating both data and the methods (functions) that operate on that data. OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and a clearer structure in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concepts in OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes and Objects**: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have. An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attributes and Properties**: These are the data members of a class, representing the characteristics of an object. They can be variables of various types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Methods**: Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the class's data. They define the behavior of the objects created from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation**: This is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It provides control over access to the internal data of an object, promoting data hiding and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) that inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). It facilitates code reuse and specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables dynamic method binding and flexibility in implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on relevant attributes and behaviors. It hides the unnecessary details and exposes only the necessary features."

    "## 4. Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, often known as a class. Encapsulation provides control over the access and modification of data by restricting direct access to the internal details of an object. This promotes data hiding, information security, and abstraction, making your code more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more detailed explanation of encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Protection**: Encapsulation prevents external code from directly modifying or accessing the internal state of an object. This helps ensure that data integrity is maintained and that unexpected changes don't disrupt the functioning of other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.    **Abstraction**: Encapsulation allows you to provide a clear interface to the outside world while hiding the internal implementation details. Users of the class only need to know how to use the provided methods, not how they are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.    **Modularity**: By encapsulating data and methods related to a specific functionality within a class, you create modular units that can be easily maintained and updated. Changes within a class are less likely to affect other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access Modifiers:\n",
    "Access modifiers are keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods). They enforce the level of encapsulation by specifying who can access or modify certain elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the common access modifiers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Public**: No access restrictions. Members are accessible from anywhere. \n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: class MyClass: def my_method(self): pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protected**: Members are accessible within the class and its subclasses. To denote protected attributes, you can use a single underscore prefix (convention). Example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "_protected_attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private**: Members are only accessible within the class. To denote private attributes, you can use a double underscore prefix. However, they are not truly private; their names are \"mangled\" to make them harder to accidentally override. Example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "__private_attribute\n",

    "## 5. Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (superclass or base class). The subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the superclass, and you can also extend or modify its behavior. Inheritance promotes code reuse, abstraction, and the creation of hierarchies in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more detailed explanation of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Class (Superclass):\n",
    "The base class, also known as the superclass or parent class, is the class that you start with. It defines the common attributes and methods that are shared among its subclasses. The base class serves as a blueprint that can be extended and specialized by subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclass (Derived Class):\n",
    "The subclass, also known as the derived class or child class, is a new class that you create based on the base class. The subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the base class. You can add new attributes and methods, override existing methods, or provide additional functionality specific to the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reuse**: Inheritance allows you to reuse the attributes and methods of a base class in multiple subclasses, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**: Inheritance helps create a hierarchy of classes, where each subclass represents a more specialized version of the superclass. This abstraction reflects real-world relationships and concepts.\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism**: Inheritance is a key aspect of polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. This promotes flexibility in code design."

    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from only one superclass.\n",

    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that focuses on simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on their essential characteristics. It involves creating abstract classes with a clear and simplified interface, while hiding the underlying implementation details. Abstraction provides a way to manage complexity and create a more understandable and manageable codebase.\n",

    "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own; it's meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes. It defines a common set of attributes and methods that its subclasses will share. Abstract classes often have abstract methods, which are methods that don't have an implementation in the abstract class itself but must be implemented in its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplification**: Abstraction focuses on the essential properties and behavior of objects, ignoring unnecessary details. This simplifies the design and makes it easier to understand the code.\n",
    "2. **Modularity**: By creating abstract classes that define a clear interface, you can create modular components that are easy to integrate into larger systems.\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Abstraction allows you to provide a consistent interface while allowing different implementations. This promotes code reuse and future extensions.\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation**: Abstract classes encapsulate the common behavior and attributes of related classes, promoting data security and hiding internal details."
