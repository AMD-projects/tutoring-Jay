# Java Swing 

This directory serves as a collection of **Java Swing** information, examples and demos.
Additionally, this project is generated using a **Gradle** build.

### Button Action Listener Demo
This directory contains a simple **Button Action Listener Demo**, showcasing two ways in 
which a button can be linked to an **Action listener** within **Java Swing**. 

When the demo is launched, two buttons are created using the two alternate methods. 
Each time the button is clicked, the terminal will update with the number of times that button has been 
clicked. This offers a template of action listener to button creation, where the tick update location
can be modified to perform any action required upon button clicking.

Use the string `"Button action listener demo"` within the demo_selection inside `App.java`
