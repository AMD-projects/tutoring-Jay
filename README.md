# Tutoring and Notes

This repository severs as a store for all tutoring and notes material. 

I offer tutoring lessons at SuperProf, the link to my profile is 
here [Travis Dawson](https://www.superprof.co.uk/java-python-matlab-tutoring-from-final-year-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence-student-learn-object-oriented-programming.html)
Please note this repository serves as a source of information, and examples to guide and help people understand concepts. The information within this notebook is to in no way enable or support plagiarism. 

## Repository Structure
### Exersizes
Within this directory are sets of Python exersizes. These are to provide additional practice when going through the 
**Getting started with Python notebook** and the **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** notebook.

### Java Swing 
This directory serves as a selection of Java Swing demos, each coded with explicit commenting 
to help make sense of using Java Swing. 

Currently available demos include:
- **Button action listener linking and action execution**

### Math
This directory serves to contain all math related documents, laying the foundations of Calculus and providing exersizes. 
Additionally, the documents contain exersizes that make use of mathematical based algorithms and solutions to problems. 
Including, but not limited to: 
- Root finding algorithms including (Bisection method, secant method, etc)
**Note:** This directory is still under development.


### Notebooks
The notebooks directory is a diverse store of notebooks that allow for direct visualization and explanation of findings. 
Current topics within notebooks include:
- **A brief overview of numerical_analysis methods**. 
  - This notebook will be expanded further to encompass a set of numerical methods. 
    - Current numerical methods included:
      - Newton-Raphson root finding algorithm
- **Getting started with Python**
  - A notebook covering and explaining the basics of Python, including exersizes. 
- **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - This notebook introduces the concept of OOP within Python through detailed explanations and multiple code examples.


### Tools
The tools directory is to share cheat-sheets and knowledge on useful tools that I have encountered and use
regularly to make my studies, and work efficients and easier. 

The tools list currently includes:
- [Conda Virtual Environment Cheat Sheet](tools/conda_virtual_environment_cheat_sheet.pdf)
- [Getting Started](tools/getting_started.pdf)
  - Set of instructions to download and setup IntelliJ IDEA and Jupyter Notebooks on Windows, Mac, and Linux


### Additional Resources and Projects: 

#### Intro to Genetic Algorithm
A genetic algorithm is an algorithm that copies the process of evolution to solve complex problems. It starts with 
different solutions and leverages the process of reproduction and mutation over time to create the best solution. 
It's like a digital puzzle solver that learns from nature's tricks to crack complex puzzles in areas like planning 
routes and improving models.
